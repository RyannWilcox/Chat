This is a small instant messaging program I created as a side project.  
This involves a server and client connecting and then sending messages to each other.  All messages sent between the
client and server programs are encrypted using RSA.

Its best if run from the command line.  The server must be run before starting the client.   
I removed my IP address for the server so before running you have to add what ever IP addressyou want to
the RunClient.java class.

The commands for running these programs:
-> java RunServer
-> java RunClient


In the near future I plan on adding a User Interface to this project.
